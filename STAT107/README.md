# Data Science Discovery

This directory contains course materials for STAT 107 - "Data Science Discovery" which I took at the University of Illinois in the fall of 2019.

**Instructors:** Karle Flanagan and Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider

*Course Description:* Data Science Discovery is the intersection of statistics, computation, and real-world relevance. As a project-driven course, students perform hands-on-analysis of real-world datasets to analyze and discover the impact of the data. Throughout each experience, students reflect on the social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.
