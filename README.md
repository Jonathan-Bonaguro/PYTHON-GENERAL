# PYTHON-GENERAL

Welcome to my Python repository! This repository exists for fun. I wanted to use GitHub for two reasons:

1. Ability to show the world I am learning to code (I am significantly more motivated when I can share results!)
2. Keep track of my development overtime. 

**This is purely for fun!** 

Hoping to learn more about using Python as a social science researcher interested in conflict, democracy, and political behavoir. 

#### Interests and Goals
1. Become more familiar with packages like NumPy and pandas
2. Learn modeling and visualization similar to my abilities in R
3. I love Natural Language Processing. I'm not sure why. But I want to learn about it. 
4. ???
